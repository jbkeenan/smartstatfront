2. **Test Mode**: Bypass authentication for testing and demonstration

## Backend Integration

This frontend is designed to work with the Django REST Framework backend. Ensure your backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `/api/auth/login/` - For user authentication
- `/api/auth/register/` - For user registration
- `/api/dashboard/` - For dashboard data
- `/api/properties/` - For property management
- `/api/thermostats/` - For thermostat control
- `/api/schedules/` - For schedule management
- `/api/calendars/` - For calendar integration

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended with new thermostat brands. The backend can add new thermostat integrations without requiring frontend code changes.
