## Installation

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com/api
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Serve the built application:
```bash
npm run serve
```

## Development

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

The application supports two authentication modes:

1. **Normal Mode**: Regular authentication with username/password
2. **Test Mode**: Bypass authentication for testing and demonstration

## Backend Integration

This frontend is designed to work with the Django REST Framework backend. Ensure your backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `/api/auth/login/` - For user authentication
- `/api/auth/register/` - For user registration
- `/api/dashboard/` - For dashboard data
- `/api/properties/` - For property management
- `/api/thermostats/` - For thermostat control
- `/api/schedules/` - For schedule management
- `/api/calendars/` - For calendar integration

## GitHub Integration

To set up automatic deployment with GitHub and Render:

1. Push this code to your GitHub repository
2. In Render dashboard, create a new Web Service
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Select "React" as the framework
5. Set the build command to `npm install && npm run build`
6. Set the publish directory to `dist`
7. Add the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your backend API

This will automatically deploy your frontend whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended with new thermostat brands. The backend can add new thermostat integrations without requiring frontend code changes.
